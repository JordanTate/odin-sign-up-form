# Sign-Up Form | The Odin Project

As the first project in the *Full Stack Javascript Path* for The Odin Project, the focus was shifted back to HTML and CSS, improving on what I had learned previously with HTML Forms, *Intermediate CSS Concepts* such as Advanced Selectors, Positioning, CSS Functions and more. 

I've aimed to include these researched concepts, more than I have considered to do in previous projects. 

My idea was to use the design sheet to create a mockup up a *health* website that focuses on marketting Green Tea leaves.
